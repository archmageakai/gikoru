<p>It is now 2025, but we got to end 2024 on a good note at Gikopoi.</p>
<p>This is just a recap of my fun on Gikopoi for Holidays 2024.</p>
<p>I've been pretty active streaming, especially when #AFK. I usually stream a lot of Nightcore playlists, but I change it up too sometimes with a variety of content.</p>
<p>We had the first annual Gikopoi Christmas Nights of Nightcore event as well. We enjoyed 2 days straight of Nightcore DJing from yours truly. It is such a blessing to be in the modern world and be able to DJ without actually being present. Thank you Gikopoi.</p>
