<p>Just a small update. This site is no longer generated using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo software</a>. This site, however, is now generated by its own software <a href="https://github.com/archmageakai/gikoru">Gikoru</a>. You can feel free to use it, change code, make it your own. It is just another project that was able to keep me stimulated and to knock the rust off for my python. The code is a bit messy anyway, or at least could use condensing. So, feel free to critique and clean as you see fit.</p>
<p>I've got some other projects in the works anyways. <a href="/sections/prison_game_reviews/">Prison Game Reviews</a> are being written out of my notebook, where they were originally wrote. I do revise them or correct spelling/grammar when necessary. Of course, adding icons and images to the review are also <i>usually</i> part of the process of transferring from physical to digital. I have a lot of chronicled works and notes that I have to transfer besides the Prison Game Reviews.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can follow this site on a feed reader of your choice as it is <a href="/index.atom">atom-ized</a> now.</p>
<p>Later.</a>
