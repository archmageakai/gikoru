<blockquote>
<p><img src="/image/green.png" alt=""> Fun hack&slash musou with a good variety of characters and skill variation that keeps things interesting.<br>

<p>I really enjoyed Fate/Stay Night visual novel and its first anime adaptation, and while I can't say I'm a true devoted fan of the Fate series: I was super excited to play Fate/Extella Link. I knew going into this that this game would be a sequel, and I did not play the original Fate/Extella. I can't exactly knock on the story too much, as I am under the impression this game is a limited sequel. Therefore, it is safe to say that this is more about enjoying characters than it is enjoying a true full-length story. I could be wrong about all that, however I think it is more important for me to focus on the musou gameplay and entertainment I got out of this title. Also, being that most of the Fate characters are mostly archetypes of certain classes/functions and also a funny interpretation of historic figures: I feel that it isn't super important that I did not play the original Fate/Extella or any of the other games in this sub-series. If that might impede your ability to want to start here with Fate, then I'm sure there are resources that will let you know the play order that is optimal for the Fate series.</p>
<p>I would say that most musou spin-offs or derivatives passed the old Dynasty Warriors are limited or really just playing Dynasty Warriors with a skin, but this game was fun enough to make me feel like I had the enjoyment of a visual novel, an RPG, and a musou game. While the story is short, the extra/optional challenges were fun as a means to grind characters and get enjoyment out of maxing social affinities, where I'd get to enjoy small moments of fun with Fate characters from even before Extella. The battle mechanics in this title are, of course, limited to musou hack&slash, yet the functionality and play style of the different characters was enough to keep me entertained. The extra skills and customization made it so that there were lots of approachs to building a character, and each character plays slightly different even if they are both from the same job/class/archetype (i.e. two Sabers)... and again, it is all a matter of how fast you wanna hit Y and X and dish out combos real easy.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with this title is that it isn't really inclusive to non-Fate fans. It really is just a fan-game. I don't think it is worth putting in the time if you don't already have an investment in Fate or some form of interest in it. There isn't a lot of diversity in how levels are structured. Conquer territories as is typical of a musou game. Yet, I like how stylish the movements/dashes and transport between different bases are, as well as the aesthetic/vibe of this game. If you want a good treat, and just want to take a break with a musou title that delivers a fun environment that encourages you to switch up your character line-up, then I really recommend you try Fate/Extella Link. (or even start with the previous title)</p>
