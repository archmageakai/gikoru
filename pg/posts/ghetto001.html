<p>IN THE BASEMENT OF MY FRIEND, THIS IS WHERE A JOURNEY MET ITS END<br>
THROUGH THE WINDOW IS WHERE I WOULD SEND MYSELF INWARD AND OUTWARD<br>
TO A WORLD WHERE SKIES SEEMED SO LIMITLESS</p>

<p>WHEN I LURKED IN THE BASEMENT, WHILE MY FRIEND WAS EXPANDING<br>
I FIND MYSELF CONTRACTING<br>
BUT AS I RETREAT, I LOOK UP AND I SEE LIMITS IN THE CEILING</p>

<p>THE CEILING WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SKY FOR ME<br>
HOPES WERE OBTAINABLE AND FAITH WASN'T NECESSARY<br>
I COULD TOUCH THE CEILING AND KNOW THAT I HAD REACHED THE TOP</p>

<p>THE CEILING WAS A PLACE I WOULD GET LOST IN<br>
IF IT WASN'T THAT, I'D GET LOST IN MYSELF<br>
WHEN I LOOK UP, I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT</p>

<p>LIFE WAS SO SIMPLE<br>
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO<br>
ALL I DID WAS TRY TO GO UP WHEN REALLY I WAS GOING DOWN</p>

<p>IN THE BASEMENT OF MY FRIEND IS WHERE I USED TO GO<br>
AND NOW IN THE BASEMENT OF MY MIND IS WHERE I GO<br>
FRIENDSHIP IS MY WINDOW OUT</p>
