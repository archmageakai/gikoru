<p>Life isn't always going to be great. Life is full of everything, and we have to take the good with the bad. I have to remind myself that a lot. Today [5/25] I got to read the JFT [ <a href="/recovery/jft_txt/05-25.txt">link here</a> ] and it spoke the words I needed to hear for awhile. It also inspired a lot of thoughts and wisdom, that have been brewing for awhile. While there are resentments and other negativities brewing in my head, I forget I can find a lot of the great thoughts and ideas I have. Negativity screams harshly and positivity cries softly. I think there is a point where we "know" something and then the other point where we "learn" something. Taking it even further, there is another even more important point and that is the point where we "apply" something.</p>
<p>I'm going to emphasize this more and more, that if you feel like you are suffering or struggling with an addiction or repetitive patterns... Get Help! Reach out! For a long time, I always felt like I was running and I wanted to change, but I couldn't. It was not until I got to prison that I found out that I lived in a prison for my whole life, of my own making. With this post, I try my best to focus on post-incarceration and its struggles, as well as not forgetting where we came from and what we learned in there. Talking about APPLICATION of knowledge above is important, because in post-incarcertation we are at that point to where we need to remember everything we KNOW and LEARNED and APPLY this to our current situation. To all my brothers and sisters out there, that are struggling with post-incarceration, if you are reading this: you can do this. Whatever you are going through.</p>
