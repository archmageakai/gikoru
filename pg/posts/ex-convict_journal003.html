<p>I'm glad I keep my side of the street clean, and that I don't have a bus ticket to prison. A lot of people are saving up for that bus ticket back to the pen, and they don't even realize that the money and their efforts are going toward that. A lot of people don't register that their drug use or alcohol use has correlation to their past incarcerations. There is a lot of ego with wanting to "fit in" with people, being able to "hang" in social circles wher alcohol is present, etc. I know that a lot of people do know better and it is their responsibility, but it can be hard watching people fall into the cycle. They are their BEST SELVES and just with one choice, you see that VANISH.</p>
<p>For myself as an individual, I am thankful I am able to see this for what it is. I know that something or someone or some force is bringing this to me, and that there is a reason I have to see so many fail right before my eyes. I really re-frame these terrible sights into messages or reminders. A wise man learns from others' mistakes, not just their own. I do feel bad that people like me are getting lost in the cycle, but the good that I do when I don't fall into that cycle can help myself and others that are ready to be done with the cycle. There is a certain amount of personal responsibility we have to take as ex-convicts/FIP. The system is just terrible, but as much as I can get into philosophical materialism and see validity in the case of injustice: I have to really stop for a minute and decide that I have to keep moving forward because there isn't much I can do or control in that situation. I don't want to give up on a future for people like me, where this doesn't have to happen. The other cruel side is that, there are a lot of ex-convicts that just give up the battle and they go with the easy way: go back to prison. Prison is easy for us, and it is comfortable. I write this now to say, don't give up, to myself and to others. Surviving out here is the only way barriers will be broken. We can't wait for the system to be reformed. Pay attention to what is going on around you, and you will see that, hopefully, wherever you are in life: you are where you are supposed to be to grow and learn.</p>
