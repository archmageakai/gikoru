<p><u>My thoughts on next blueprint</u></p>
<li>Well, we got us a cell door this time, so you aren't trapped in there forever. You can get out for some dayroom, yard or chow... or maybe your prison job!</li>
<li>I think it'd be cool to get into making an isometric prison cell drawing, for more details... but I'm  having fun reminiscing with a 2d drawing.</li>
<p><u>Benefits of making blueprints</u></p>
<li>Keeps me disciplined, even though last drawing was 2 months ago almost exactly.</li>
<li>Fun hobby</li>
<li>keeps me sharp</li>
<li>helps me learn more libreCAD (which can be a bit different in some ways from the softwares its inspired/derived from), as I prefer not to use bloatware</li>
