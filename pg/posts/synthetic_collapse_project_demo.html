<p>This is a project demo that I've been working on with UxSxOxTxLxSxFx, and we've been talking about collabing for a long time. Finally our first collaboration is here, and it was a blast working with them along with Hatsune Miku and the chinchilla friends. Thank you to everyone who helped out and all the support. (you know who you are) This project demo is on the applecamp records label bandcamp page linked above, so be sure to download it there for free (or donate if you want). I have a lot of other projects and ideas, so I look forward to releasing those whenever I can. Enjoy.</p>

<p>** <u>Bonus content</u> **</p>
<p>There is bonus content collectables included in the demo's folder. You will need to convert Track 05 and 06 from .wav to .bmp ... Here is the process you need to unlock your collectables:</p>
<p>* 1. Download Audacity Portable 2.4.2 [ this is where I downloaded : <a href="https://audacity-portable.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/2491023">link here</a> ]</p>
<p>* 2. Download the demo as WAV files on bandcamp.</p>
<p>* 3. Drag and drop one track (either 05 or 06) into a new Audacity window.</p>
<p>* 4. File -> Export -> Export Audio</p>
<p>* 5. In Export Audio window: Set "Save as type" to "Other uncompressed files"; "Header" to "RAW (header-less)"; "Encoding" to "U-Law"</p>
<p>* 6. DO NOT SAVE YET. Set the file name to your_filename_here.bmp (as long as the file extension is .bmp, this will work), and then Save.</p>
<p>* 7. You can now repeat these steps for the next track in the folder.</p>
<p>If you followed through with these steps, you should have two .bmp files with some bonus collectable content, rare and secrete stuff! Have fun!</p>
