>>>>>> IDEAS >>>>>>
-Make a drafts folder, make it so that the draft file is generated at the beginning as DRAFT in line 1, any file with POST in line 1 is moved to posts folder
this would be processed before POST MAKER part of code

-Make an atom feed
 *change it so that POSTS read 2024-12-08T21:33:19-05:00 and reads YYYY-MM-DD to format out as <time datetime="2024-12-08T21:33:19-05:00">December 8, 2024</time> on post (check if thats correct for EST time) ************RFC3339 format
 *once thats functioning, make lists for atom based on INDEX and SECTION and sort by NEWEST TO OLDEST
 *then feed the lists into feed.atom file
