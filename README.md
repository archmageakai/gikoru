# Recommended to save Gikoru to your home directory

### Files in main directory
>gikoru.py - run this to generate site\
>new_content.py - this will put an html file in drafts, edit your file in drafts, and when ready make line 1 read POST\
>www.py - akai uses this to move his public directory to ~/www , for his own purposes of push and pulling to deploy his site\
>to do list.txt - a to do list\
>README.md - you're reading it now

### Directories explained

>drafts : this folder is is where drafts are stored, new_content.py sends files here.\
>pg : these are input files, fragments/partial html files that are built before being merged and put in the output directory, see head.html, header.html, footer.html, these are to be edited primarily\
>pg/$$$pages/ : place any misc pages you want merged with head, header, and footer, such as 404.html or contact.html for example)\
>pg/index/ : all index fragments are generated and stored here (these may or may not be treated as temp files that would be deleted later)\
>pg/posts/ : post fragments are stored here (these may or may not be treated as temp files that would be deleted later)\
>pg/sections/ : sections (incl. index) fragments are stored here (these may or may not be treated as temp files that would be deleted later)\
>posts : these are where all posts are stored. these can be edited after they've been sent here.\
>public : this is the output directory. all these files can be deployed to your site.\
>py : aside from the main script, content file and www python scripts, most python scripts for gikoru are stored here\
static : all static files, such as images, favicon, css, misc that you do not want merged are stored here

### ramblings of a madman

A lot of the initial development was just pulling lists and so I got caught up making list files and so, the nature of the development is really just what I chalk up this code to. Definitely will clean it up a bit, or even try something different for just the sake of a little exercise/practice/challenge.
But, I also really enjoy just chillin in gikopoi and streaming Hamtaro all day too.
