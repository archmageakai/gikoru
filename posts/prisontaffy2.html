You might have enjoyed my <a href="/posts/prisontaffy.html">previous article</a> on Prison Taffy and how to make it. This article is more about showing a way I get creative with the taffy, because candy is always great to be colorful and stylish. In the picture above, I made two new flavors: Strawberry and Orange. I roll part of each flavor separately and make "Taffy twists" or you can also mix pieces to have a mixed ball of flavor like shown above. Periodically, I'll be showing ways I get creative with taffy as I come up with more ideas. This was something very common in prison, and I'd love to explore more ways to expand on Prison Taffy now that I'm out here.
