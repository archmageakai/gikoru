<p>I haven't done any actual update regarding the blog in awhile. I just have mostly been in post-mode or not posting as much as of late. This post is more in lines with my last post, discussing about blog/static page generation of the site. I started out messing with the Hugo software very briefly, and then I wanted something more module (and outside the Go language). I wrote some really messy python scripts that worked, and that was what I built on and worked with for months. Now the blog generator has been reformatted as well as rewritten in Emacs Lisp. I really have had a great time writing in Emacs Lisp, past the .emacs file. I hope I can soon write more programs in Emacs Lisp, that are part of my daily/regular routine. My mental health and wellbeing have never been the same without GNU Emacs and Org mode.
